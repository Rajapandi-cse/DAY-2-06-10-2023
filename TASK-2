write a blog on the difference between document and window objects ?
     In web development, the Document and Window objects are part of the Document Object Model (DOM). Here's a brief distinction:

Document Object:

      .The document object represents the entire HTML document.
      .It provides methods and properties to interact with the content of the document, such as selecting elements, modifying HTML, and handling events.
      .Common actions involve manipulating the structure and content of the webpage.

Window Object:

      .The window object represents the browser window or a tab.
      .It encompasses the entire browser environment and includes properties like location, navigator, and history.
      .It also provides methods for controlling the browser, such as opening new windows, setting timeouts, and managing cookies.
      
           In summary, the document object deals with the content of the webpage, while the window object deals with the browser environment.
